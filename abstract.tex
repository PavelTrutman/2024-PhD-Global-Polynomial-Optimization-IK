\chapter*{Abstract}
Many problems in robotics with direct application in practice are modeled by systems of polynomial equations or as polynomial optimization tasks.
In this work, we review an application of techniques used in semidefinite programming to polynomial systems solving and to polynomial optimization tasks solving.
These techniques allow us to solve overconstrained polynomial systems efficiently as well as to search for the optimum of underconstrained systems.
Furthermore, the methods from semidefinite programming allow us to find real solutions of polynomial systems only leading to more efficient algorithms compared to algebraic methods, which find all complex solutions.
In this work, we utilize semidefinite programming to come with more efficient and robust tools for solving real problems from robotics.
This approach is novel in this field of study.

We demonstrate the method on a long-established problem in robotics, the inverse kinematics (IK) problem.
IK problem is to find robot control parameters to bring it into the desired position under the kinematics and collision constraints.
We present a global solution to the optimal IK problem for a general serial 7DOF manipulator with revolute joints and a quadratic polynomial objective function.
We show that the kinematic constraints due to rotations can all be generated by second-degree polynomials.
This is important since it significantly simplifies the further step where we find the optimal solution by Lasserre's relaxations of non-convex polynomial systems.
We demonstrate that the second relaxation is sufficient to solve the 7DOF IK problem.
Our approach is certifiably globally optimal.
We demonstrate the method on 7DOF \textit{KUKA LBR IIWA} manipulator and show that we are able to compute the optimal IK or certify in-feasibility in $99.9$~\% tested poses.
